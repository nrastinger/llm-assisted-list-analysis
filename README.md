# **LLM-based NER for (historical) lists: From semi-structured texts to structured data**

The Jupyter Notebook and files available here were initially created as part of a broader case study titled ["Visiting Vienna"](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/research/literary-textual-studies/research/linked-data-vienna-time-machine/visiting-vienna) that focused on **automatic information extraction from periodically published lists found in historical newspapers and advertising papers** (cf. [Rastinger 2024](https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp210016), supported by the City of vienna and and an ÖAW DOC fellowship). Specifically, it addressed the arrival lists published in the *Wien[n]erisches Diarium* from 1703 to 1725 and demonstrated how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be used for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to transform  historical semi-structured texts into structured data better suitable for analysis. With the idea of re-using this workflow for further (types of) lists, the Notebook has since been updated and further expanded. A major part of the follow-up work was done in the context of the project ["KI-gestützte Rekonstruktion marginalisierter mobiler Gruppen: Semi-automatische Informationsextraktion aus frühneuzeitlichen Fremdenlisten"](https://www.uni-bremen.de/institut-fuer-geschichtswissenschaft/epochen-und-bereiche/fruehe-neuzeit/forschung/ki-gestuetzte-rekonstruktion-marginalisierter-mobiler-gruppen) at the University of Bremen, which deals with transfering the developed workflow to the arrival lists published in the *Regensburgisches Diarium* (RD).
